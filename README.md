# AWS SSO To Credentials file

WIth advent of AWS SSO V2, no backward compatible credential file is created. It breaks some tools like terraform and serverless which does not support cached credentials generated by aws sso.

With this simple shell script I try to refresh the session token and then export it to a credential file.

Usage:

``` shell
./aws_sso_to_credentials.sh -e 'https://some.awsapps.com/start\#/' [-r 'eu-west-1'] [-p 'some-profile'] [-s] [-b]
```
